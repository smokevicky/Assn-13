Using jQuery do following things:

#1. Create a javascript array with list of students(Id, FirstName, LastName, Gender, Country, state, city).	
#2. Create a javascript array with list of countries(Id, Name)
#3. Create a javascript array with list of States(Id, Name, CountryId)
#4. Create a javascript array with list of Cities(Id, Name, StateId)
#5. Put add button, after clicking on this button, add student form will be sliding down to input student detail and save. 
This form will contain:
FirstName, LastName(textbox)
Gender(radion buttons)
Country, State, City(Cascading dropdownlist)
All filelds are required. Need to check required field validation for all fields before doing save. After saving, 
populate grid with updated students.
#6. Create a grid to display all students. Every row has a edit and delete link. After clicking on edit link, edit
 form will be displayed with student information, user can edit and save details and populate grid with updated 
students. This form also contains same field like Add Student Form. After clicking on delete link, delete a student 
from list and populate grid with updated students.

Note: Everything will be done on client side and without page refresh.
